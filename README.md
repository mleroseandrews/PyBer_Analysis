# PyBer_Analysis
##Project Overview
The overall task of this project was to analyze and visualize the ride share data of three city types; Urban, Suburban, and Rural, from January to the end of April.  
### Data Analyzed
-Total Rides per City Type
-Total Fares per City Type
-Total Drivers per City Type
-Percentage of total Riders by City Type
-Percentage of total Fares by City Type

### Conclusions
-Population overall is highest in Urban areas. As such, there are alot more rides in Urban areas and the least amount of rides in Rural areas.  
-The number of rides per city type correlates with the amount of drivers needed as you can see by comparing Figure 1 and Figure 2.  
-Urban areas account for 80% of the total drivers as seen in Figure 3.  
-Rides are longer in rural areas because businesses and homes are more spread out which leads to higher fares than in Urban areas.    (Figure 4)
-Even though fare prices per rider is higher in rural areas, (Figure 4) the percentage of the overall fares by city type is lowest in rural areas with accounting for only 6.8% of the total fares.   (Figure 5)

#### Summary
After analyzing the data there are 3 business recommendations for the CEO of PyBer.   Ride Share iniatives, marketing and driver incentives would be highly recommended for rural areas since it takes the driver longer to get from the pickup location to drop-off.  Since there are less drivers, the wait time is more than likely higher.    With that being said, I would recommend analyzing the data on wait times between when a driver requests a ride and when they are picked up.   I would also recommend analyzing the data on the duration of the ride by city type.   This data can make sure that the number of drivers in the area is sufficient to meet the needs of the rider is the area.   By lowering wait times you can make sure that Pyber is the #1 ride share company that riders choose in the area.
